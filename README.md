#### What is the best usage of Nancy?

The preferred way to use Nancy is:
- `go list -json -m all | nancy sleuth`
- `nancy sleuth -p /path/to/Gopkg.lock`

#### Homebrew usage

`nancy` can be installed using `brew`:

- `brew tap sonatype-nexus-community/homebrew-nancy-tap`
- `brew install nancy`

`brew` formulae are created and published to that tap with each new release, so you can use `brew` to upgrade, etc... as you wish.

You can see more about the formulae, etc... at [this repo](https://github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/homebrew-nancy-tap).

#### Docker usage

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/nancy/blob/master/docs/images/nancy_docker.png" width="350"/>
</p>

`nancy` now comes in a boat! For ease of use, we've dockerized `nancy`. To use our Dockerfile:

`go list -json -m all | docker run --rm -i sonatypecommunity/nancy:latest`

We publish a few different flavors for convenience:

- Latest if you want to be on the bleeding edge ex: `latest`
- The full tag for those concerned with 100% reliability of underlying Nancy ex: `v0.1.1`
- The major version (we respect semver) ex: `v0`
- The major/minor version (seriously, we respect semver) ex: `v0.1`

### OSS Index Options

#### Rate limiting / Setting OSS Index config

**NOTE: New as of Nancy v0.1.17**

If you start using Nancy extensively, you might run into Rate Limiting from OSS Index! Don't worry, we've got your back!

If you run into Rate Limiting you should receive an error that will give you instructions on how to register on OSS Index:

```
You have been rate limited by OSS Index.
If you do not have a OSS Index account, please visit https://ossindex.sonatype.org/user/register to register an account.
After registering and verifying your account, you can retrieve your username (Email Address), and API Token
at https://ossindex.sonatype.org/user/settings. Upon retrieving those, run 'nancy config', set your OSS Index
settings, and rerun Nancy.
```

After setting this config, you'll be gifted a nice new higher rate limit. If you escape this limit, you might take a look at using Nexus IQ Server, or reach out to the friendly people at OSS Index for partnership opportunities.

You can also set the user and token via the command line like so:

`nancy sleuth --username auser@anemailaddress.com --token A4@k3@p1T0k3n`

This can be handy for testing your account out, or if you want to override your set config with a different user.

#### Loud mode

By default, `nancy` runs in a "quiet" mode, only displaying a list of vulnerable components. 
You can run `nancy` in a loud manner, showing all components by running:

* `./nancy sleuth --loud -p /path/to/your/Gopkg.lock`
* `go list -json -m all | ./nancy sleuth --loud`

#### Exclude vulnerabilities

Sometimes you'll run into a dependency that after taking a look at, you either aren't affected by, or cannot resolve for some reason. Nancy understands, and will let you 
exclude these vulnerabilities so you can get back to a passing build:

Vulnerabilities excluded will then be silenced and not show up in the output or fail your build.

We support exclusion of vulnerability either by CVE-ID (ex: `CVE-2018-20303`) or via the OSS Index ID (ex: `a8c20c84-1f6a-472a-ba1b-3eaedb2a2a14`) as not all vulnerabilities have a CVE-ID.

##### Via CLI flag
* `./nancy sleuth --exclude-vulnerability CVE-789,bcb0c38d-0d35-44ee-b7a7-8f77183d1ae2 -p /path/to/your/Gopkg.lock`
* `go list -json -m all | ./nancy sleuth --exclude-vulnerability CVE-789,bcb0c38d-0d35-44ee-b7a7-8f77183d1ae2`

##### Via file
By default if a file named `.nancy-ignore` exists in the same directory that nancy is run it will use it, will no other options need to be passed.

If you would like to define the path to the file you can use the following
* `./nancy sleuth --exclude-vulnerability-file=/path/to/your/exclude-file -p /path/to/your/Gopkg.lock`
* `go list -json -m all | ./nancy sleuth --exclude-vulnerability-file=/path/to/your/exclude-file`

The file format requires each vulnerability that you want to exclude to be on a separate line. Comments are allowed in the file as well to help provide context when needed. See an example file below.

```
# This vulnerability is coming from package xyz, we are ok with this for now
CVN-111 
CVN-123 # Mitigated the risk of this since we only use one method in this package and the affected code doesn't matter
CVN-543
``` 
It's also possible to define expiring ignores. Meaning that if you define a date on a vulnerability ignore until that date it will be ignored and once that 
date is passed it will now be reported by nancy if its still an issue. Format to add an expiring ignore looks as follows. They can also be followed up by comments 
to provide context to as why its been ignored until that date.    

```
CVN-111 until=2021-01-01
CVN-543 until=2018-02-12 #Waiting on release from third party. Should be out before this date but gives us a little time to fix it. 
```

#### Output

We support multiple different output formats. Examples can be found below for each. [This intentionally vulnerable repo](https://github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/intentionally-vulnerable-golang-project) was used to generate the example output.
Quiet option is supported in text and csv. json formatting will ignore the Quiet option and output the same values if it's passed or not.  

*text (default)*

### Nexus IQ Server Options

By default, assuming you have an out of the box Nexus IQ Server running, you can run `nancy` like so:

`go list -json -m all | ./nancy iq --iq-application public-application-id`

It is STRONGLY suggested that you do not do this, and we will warn you on output if you are.

A more logical use of `nancy` against Nexus IQ Server will look like so:

`go list -json -m all | ./nancy iq --iq-application public-application-id --iq-username nondefaultuser --iq-token yourtoken --iq-server-url http://adifferentserverurl:port --iq-stage develop`

Options for stage are as follows:

`build, develop, stage-release, release`

By default `--iq-stage` will be `develop`.

Successful submissions to Nexus IQ Server will result in either an OS exit of 0, meaning all is clear and a response akin to:

```
Wonderbar! No policy violations reported for this audit!
Report URL:  http://reportURL
```

Failed submissions will either indicate failure because of an issue with processing the request, or a policy violation. Both will exit with a code of 1, allowing you to fail your build in CI. Policy Violation failures will include a report URL where you can learn more about why you encountered a failure.

Policy violations will look like:

```
Hi, Nancy here, you have some policy violations to clean up!
Report URL:  http://reportURL
```

Errors processing in Nexus IQ Server will look like:

```
Uh oh! There was an error with your request to Nexus IQ Server: <error>
```

#### Persistent Nexus IQ Server Config

Nancy lets you set the Nexus IQ Server Address, User and Token as persistent config (application and stage are generally per project so we do not let you set these globally).

To set your Nexus IQ Server config run:

`nancy config`

Choose `iq` as an option and run through the rest of the config. Once you are done, Nancy should use this config for communicating with Nexus IQ, simplifying your use of the tool.

### Usage in CI

You can see an example of using `nancy` in Travis-CI at [this intentionally vulnerable repo we made](https://github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/intentionally-vulnerable-golang-project).

Nancy as well runs on it self (delicious dog food!) in CircleCI, in a myriad of fashions. You can see how we do that here in [our repo's CircleCI config](https://github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/nancy/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml).

### DISCLAIMER

A portion of the golang ecosystem doesn't use proper versions, and instead uses a commit hash to resolve your dependency. Dependencies like this will not work with
`nancy` quite yet, as we don't have a mechanism on OSS Index to lookup vulnerabilities in that manner. 

## Why Nancy?

[Nancy Drew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Drew) was the first female detective used extensively in literature, and gave women across the world a new hero.

This project is called `nancy` as like the great detective herself, it looks for problems you might not be aware of, and gives you the information to help put them to an end!

## Installation

At the current time you have a few options:

* Build from source
* Download release binary from [here on GitHub](https://github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/nancy/releases)

### Build from source

* Clone the project `git clone github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/nancy`
* In the root of the project run `make`
  * This will execute multiple targets so if you want to short circuit some of that process you can also just run `make build` to get the binary without running tests, linting, etc
* Use that binary where ever your heart so desires!

### Download release binary

Each tag pushed to this repo creates a new release binary, and if you'd like to skip building from source, you can download a binary similar to:

```console
$ curl -o /path/where/you/want/nancy \
  https://github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/nancy/releases/download/v0.0.44/nancy-darwin.amd64-v0.0.44
```

## Development

`nancy` is written using Golang 1.13, so it is best you start there.

Tests can be run like this `make test`

Adding new files? Get the license header correct with:

> go get -u github.com/google/addlicense
> addlicense -f ./header.txt .

### Release Process

Follow the steps below to release a new version of Nancy. You need to be part of the `deploy from circle ci` group for this to work.

  1. Checkout/pull the latest `master` branch, and create a new tag with the desired semantic version and a helpful note:
  
         git tag -a v0.1.x -m "Helpful message in tag."
         
  2. Push the tag up:
  
         git push origin v0.1.x
         
  3. There is no step 3.
